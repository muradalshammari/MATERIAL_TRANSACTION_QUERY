/* PO_HEADERS_ALL */

/* PO_HEADERS_ALL CONTAINS HEADER INFORMATION FOR YOUR PURCHASING DOCUMENTS. YOU NEED ONE ROW FOR EACH DOCUMENT YOU CREATE. 
THERE ARE SIX TYPES OF DOCUMENTS THAT USE PO_HEADERS_ALL: RFQS, QUOTATIONS, STANDARD PURCHASE ORDERS, 
PLANNED PURCHASE ORDERS, BLANKET PURCHASE ORDERS AND CONTRACTS. EACH ROW CONTAINS BUYER INFORMATION, 
SUPPLIER INFORMATION, BRIEF NOTES, FOREIGN CURRENCY INFORMATION, TERMS AND CONDITIONS INFORMATION, AND THE STATUS OF THE DOCUMENT. 
ORACLE PURCHASING USES THIS INFORMATION TO RECORD INFORMATION THAT IS RELATED TO A COMPLETE DOCUMENT. 
PO_HEADER_ID IS THE UNIQUE SYSTEM-GENERATED PRIMARY KEY AND IS INVISIBLE TO THE USER. 
SEGMENT1 IS THE SYSTEM-ASSIGNED NUMBER YOU USE TO IDENTIFY THE DOCUMENT IN FORMS AND REPORTS. 
ORACLE PURCHASING GENERATES SEGMENT1 USING THE PO_UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER_CONT_ALL TABLE IF YOU CHOOSE TO LET ORACLE PURCHASING GENERATE DOCUMENT NUMBERS FOR YOU. 
SEGMENT1 IS NOT UNIQUE FOR THE ENTIRE TABLE. 
DIFFERENT DOCUMENT TYPES CAN SHARE THE SAME NUMBERS. 
YOU CAN UNIQUELY IDENTIFY A ROW IN PO_HEADERS_ALL USING PRC_BU_ID, SEGMENT1, AND TYPE_LOOKUP_CODE, OR USING PO_HEADER_ID. IF APPROVED_FLAG IS 'Y', 
THE PURCHASE ORDER IS APPROVED. IF YOUR DOCUMENT TYPE IS A BLANKET PURCHASE ORDER, CONTRACT PURCHASE ORDER, RFQ, OR QUOTATION, 
ORACLE PURCHASING USES START_DATE AND END_DATE TO STORE THE VALID DATE RANGE FOR THE DOCUMENT. 
ORACLE PURCHASING ONLY USES BLANKET_TOTAL_AMOUNT FOR BLANKET PURCHASE ORDERS OR CONTRACT PURCHASE ORDERS. 
IF YOU AUTOCREATE A QUOTATION FROM AN RFQ USING THE COPY DOCUMENT WINDOW, ORACLE PURCHASING STORES THE FOREIGN KEY TO YOUR ORIGINAL RFQ IN FROM_HEADER_ID. 
ORACLE PURCHASING ALSO USES FROM_TYPE_LOOKUP_CODE TO INDICATE THAT YOU COPIED THE QUOTATION FROM AN RFQ. 
ORACLE PURCHASING DOES NOT USE SUMMARY_FLAG AND ENABLED_FLAG. 
BECAUSE FUTURE VERSIONS OF ORACLE PURCHASING WILL USE THEM, SUMMARY_FLAG AND ENABLED_FLAG SHOULD ALWAYS BE 'N' AND 'Y' RESPECTIVELY. 
YOU ENTER DOCUMENT HEADER INFORMATION IN THE HEADER REGION OF THE PURCHASE ORDERS, RFQS, AND QUOTATIONS WINDOWS.  */

YOU GROUP YOUR RECEIPTS BY THE SOURCE TYPE AND THE SOURCE OF THE RECEIPT. 
ORACLE PURCHASING DOES NOT ALLOW YOU TO GROUP RECEIPTS FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES UNDER ONE RECEIPT HEADER. . 
THERE ARE TWO RECEIPT SOURCE TYPES, SUPPLIER AND INTERNAL ORDER, THAT YOU NEED TO USE WHEN RECEIVING AGAINST DIFFERENT SOURCE DOCUMENT TYPES. 
YOU USE A RECEIPT SOURCE TYPE OF 'SUPPLIER' WHEN RECEIVING ITEMS THAT YOU ORDERED FROM AN EXTERNAL SUPPLIER USING A PURCHASE ORDER. 
WHEN YOU RECEIVE ITEMS THAT ARE PART OF AN INTER-ORGANIZATION TRANSFER, 
OR WHEN RECEIVING ITEMS THAT YOU REQUEST FROM YOUR INVENTORY USING AN INTERNAL REQUISITION, 
THE RECEIPT TYPE WOULD BE 'INTERNAL ORDER'. THE 'INTERNAL ORDER' RECEIPT SOURCE TYPE POPULATES THE ORGANIZATION_ID COLUMN. . 
ORACLE PURCHASING CREATES A RECEIPT HEADER WHEN YOU ARE ENTERING YOUR RECEIPTS OR WHEN YOU PERFORM INTER-ORGANIZATION TRANSFERS USING ORACLE INVENTORY. 
WHEN ORACLE INVENTORY CREATES A RECEIPT HEADER FOR AN INTRANSIT SHIPMENT, THE RECEIPT NUMBER IS NOT POPULATED UNTIL YOU RECEIVE THE SHIPMENT. . */
